# Medal.tv
Review for the Medal.tv installer.

Maintainers: @azpha

**Is the program properly opened?**  
Grade: Gold  
Additional notes: n/a

**Is it showing alerts or other warnings?**  
Grade: Gold
Additional notes: Some console errors, but they don't seem to hinder functionality.

**Does it show graphical glitches?**  
Grade: Silver  
Additional notes: The navbar is a struggle to move if the window isn't big enough, but it does open and work

**Does it require some tweaking in order to work properly? (Out of normal software configuration)**  
Grade: Gold
Additional notes: Worth noting that the best runner to use this with is Caffe as others give an administrator error.

**Did it crash during tests execution?**  
Grade: Gold  
Additional notes: 
Without installing dependencies first, it seems like .NET was struggling to install directly from the installer. 
Once you run the installer, the app will launch which won't terminate the install process. Seemingly the fix is killing Bottles manually after the app launches for the first time.
Relaunching Bottles should have the shortcut to the EXE preinstalled in the bottle.

**Is it usable?**  
Grade: Gold  
Additional notes: The recorder and editor don't work, but importing/uploading/sharing will still work

**Final grade? (the lower evaluation from previous questions)**  
Grade: Gold
Additional notes: The app overall works perfectly fine and you can use the core features to share gaming moments.

**Additional notes**  
As mentioned above, the recorder and editor will not work. You're still able to import/upload/share content, though.
