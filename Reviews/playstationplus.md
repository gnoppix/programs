# PlayStation Plus
Review for the PlayStation Plus installer.

Maintainer: @domb84

**Is the program properly opened?**  
Grade: Silver  
Additional notes: Seems to work perfectly within a desktop environment. When run on a Steam Deck the first time a game is launched a new session appears to open to a different game. Closing this window and starting again resumes normal operation.

**Is it showing alerts or other warnings?**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: n/a

**Does it show graphical glitches?**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: n/a

**Does it require some tweaking in order to work properly? (Out of normal software configuration)**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: n/a

**Did it crash during tests execution?**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: n/a

**Is it usable?**

**Final grade? (the lower evaluation from previous questions)**  
Grade: Silver  
Additional notes: n/a

**Additional notes**  
Hardware acceleration does not work under Wine, but does not seem to affect performance. Added registry keys so that HW acceleration is disabled by default.
