# Guide lines
This document show the guide lines with all methods for writing and propose new installers in Gnoppix.

Each installer need a manifest in YAML format to be interpreted by Gnoppix.

## Example
These manifests can be used as example:
- https://github.com/gnoppix/programs/blob/main/Games/epicgamestore.yml
- https://github.com/gnoppix/programs/blob/main/Games/steam.yml
- https://github.com/gnoppix/programs/blob/main/Games/uplay.yml

## Structure
Each manifest has 5 sections:
- header
- dependencies
- executable
- parameters (need documentation)
- steps

### Header
```yaml
Name: epicgamestore
Description: The official Epic Games launcher.
Grade: Gold
```

where:
- **Name** is the lowercased, special characters and white spaces free name of the software (generally the file name without the extension)
- **Description** this is a short description of the software
- **Grade** Broken|Bronze|Silver|Gold|Platinum this is NOT the grade declared in ProtonDB or WineHQ. Read the Grades section.

### Dependencies
This is a list of dependencies required by the software and that should be installed by the installer.

```yaml
Dependencies:
- d3dx9
- msls31
- riched20
- allfonts
- d3dcompiler_43
- d3dcompiler_47
```

### Executable
These parameters are used by Gnoppix for multiple scopes:
- create the desktop entry
- register the program in the bottle

```yaml
Executable:
  name: Epic Games Store
  icon: epicgamestore.svg
  file: EpicGamesLauncher.exe
  path: Program Files (x86)/Epic Games/Launcher/Portal/Binaries/Win32
  arguments: -opengl -SkipBuildPatchPrereq
```

where:
- **name** is the full name of the program (special charactes and white spaces allowed)
- **icon** the name from the data directory. Read the Data section.
- **file** the name of the executable to start the program
- **path** path (inside the `bottle/drive_c` directory) to the executable (without the executable itself)
- **arguments** optional arguments to pass to the executable on start

### Steps
These actions are interpreted and performed by Gnoppix to install the software.

```yaml
Steps:
- action: install_exe
  file_name: SteamSetup.exe
  url: https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/client/installer/SteamSetup.exe
  file_checksum: 29a0d4f99b2ad92bc67d276c0c43d603
  arguments: /S
```

in the above example:
- **action** is set to `install_exe`, then Gnoppix will install an executable
- **file_name** is the name of the executable
- **url** the full url to the executable
- **file_checksum** the MD5 checksum for the executable
- **arguments** optional arguments to pass to the executable

#### Supported actions
- **install_exe** to install .exe files
- **install_msi** to install .msi files

## Grades
The following metrics should be used to define the compatibility grade of the installer.

### Valuation tests
Since any software has different behaviors, we cannot define common tests, but we can provide questions for the maintainer to answer using a supported grade (Broken, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum):
- Is the program properly opened?
- Is it showing alerts or other warnings?
- Does it show graphical glitches?
- Does it require some tweaking in order to work properly? (Out of normal software configuration)
- Did it crash during tests execution?
- Is it usable?
- Final grade? (the lower evaluation from previous questions)

These questions should be answered in a file named as the installer name and placed in the `Reviews` directory of this repository. [This review](https://github.com/gnoppix/programs/blob/main/Reviews/epicgamestore.md) can be used as template.

The maintainer can also provide additional notes to other maintainers and users.

## Data
In the repository root there is a `data` directroy which can be used to store specific installer files (e.g. the icon for the desktop entry).

Each installer should have a directory inside `data` named as the installer itself. [This](https://github.com/gnoppix/programs/tree/main/data/epicgamestore) can be used as example.
